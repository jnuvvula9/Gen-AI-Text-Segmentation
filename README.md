# Gen-AI-Text-Segmentation
Deep Learning Project

With recent advancements in complex machine learning algorithms, it has become increasingly effortless for models to generate
text that closely mimics human writing. However, even the most advanced language models can sometimes produce text that contains
subtle inconsistencies that keen readers can discern. Our approach continues a line of workthat aims to precisely determine the
boundary where a human-written prompt concludes and a machine-generated continuation begins.These findings can impact various domains, 
including journalism, law, finance, and academia,where work integrity can be tampered with by machine text.
